# RaspPiDrone
This repository contains control and server software for a Raspberry Pi commanded, Naze 32 drone.
The Raspberry Pi communicates via the Multiwii Serial Protocol to the Naze where instructions are decoded
and flight is enabled.

In addition, a wireless network is broadcast by the drone, and it hosts a webpage that allows any wifi connected
device to establish control of the device.

All of the details on how it was built and how it works can be seen at https://sites.google.com/ddsb.ca/the-rav-project/home
